## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of linear regression using the California Housing dataset. The objective is to predict the median house prices in various districts of California based on features such as median income, house age, average number of rooms, and more.

## Dataset

The California Housing dataset, derived from the 1990 U.S. Census, includes the following features:

- `MedInc`: Median income in block group.
- `HouseAge`: Median house age in block group.
- `AveRooms`: Average number of rooms per household.
- `AveBedrms`: Average number of bedrooms per household.
- `Population`: Population in block group.
- `AveOccup`: Average number of household members.
- `Latitude`: Block group latitude.
- `Longitude`: Block group longitude.

The target variable is:

- `MedHouseVal`: Median house value for California districts.
