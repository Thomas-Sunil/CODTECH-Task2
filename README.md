Linear Regression on California Housing Dataset
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of linear regression using the California Housing dataset. The goal is to predict the median house prices in various districts of California based on multiple features such as average income, house age, and more.

The dataset contains the following features:

MedInc: Median income in block group.
HouseAge: Median house age in block group.
AveRooms: Average number of rooms per household.
AveBedrms: Average number of bedrooms per household.
Population: Population in block group.
AveOccup: Average number of household members.
Latitude: Block group latitude.
Longitude: Block group longitude.
The target variable is:
